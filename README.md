1. Classes

In Node.js, classes are used to create custom objects. They are similar to classes in other object-oriented programming languages. A class is essentially a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behavior of an object.

2. Arrow Functions

In Node.js, arrow functions are used to create concise functions. They are often used as callbacks or when a short, one-line function is needed.
In Node.js, there are three ways to declare variables: let, const, and var.

let declares a variable that can be reassigned.
const declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.
var declares a variable that can be reassigned, but it has some differences in scope compared to let and const.

3.  Array method
arrays have several built-in methods that can be used to manipulate and transform arrays. Here are some examples:

push(): adds one or more elements to the end of an array
pop(): removes the last element from an array
shift(): removes the first element from an array
unshift(): adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array
map(): creates a new array with the results of applying a function to each element
filter(): creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by a function
reduce(): reduces an array to a single value by applying a function to each element

4.  Destructuring

In Node.js, destructuring is a way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables.

5. the cube of any number was just to multiply all the numbers by the given side which will be multiplied three times.

6. to create a function that gives the area of a rectangle you must get what length is and breath and then multiply it together to get the area of the rectangle which is L X B.

7.    Variable Method
Variable method is broken down into three main parts which are cost, let and var
